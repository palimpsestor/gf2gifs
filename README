GF2GIFs converts the "generic font" files output by METAFONT into sets of GIF images.

REQUIREMENTS

  GF2GIFs is a Java application.  In order to run GF2GIFs, you
  will need a (modern) Java runtime environment.


CONTENTS

  README	This file.

  pom.xml   The maven pom file for this project.

  samples	Two sample generic font files that were output
		    from METAFONT: io.2602gf is the result of running
		    METAFONT on io.mf as explained in Chapter 5 of
		    Donald Knuth's METAFONTbook; bcmr17.118gf results
		    from a special backwards version of Knuth's own
		    Computer Modern Roman 17 point.  (See
		    http://www.slurm.com/gf2gifs/backwards/ for details.)

  src		The Java source code for the program(s).


INSTALLATION

  This version of GF2GIFs was build as a maven project.  To compile, from within the installation directory, run
    mvn compile
  Then
    mvn package
  will produce a gf2gifs-1.1.0.jar file in the 'target' subdirectory.

USAGE

  Once you have produced the gf2gifs-1.1.0.jar file,
  you should be able to invoke the GF2GIFs program by typing

    mvn -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.slurm.gf.GF2GIFs -Dexec.args="--help"

  This invocation will give you a brief list of the available command line
  options and their effects.

  A typical usage might be something like

    mkdir temp
    mvn -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.slurm.gf.GF2GIFs -Dexec.args="-tb -d temp samples/io.2602gf"

  This invocation would create two GIF images (one for each
  character in the io font) with transparent backgrounds, and place
  them in the newly created 'temp' subdirectory.
