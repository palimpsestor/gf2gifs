Contains classes for parsing and manipulating &quot;generic font&quot;
files.
<p>
Generic font files, or .gf files,  are the output of
<a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/metafont.html">METAFONT</a>,
the wonderful font design system created by
<a href="http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Professor Donald&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Knuth</a>.
<p>
The classes here include a .gf file parser based on the
<a href="http://www.tug.org/web2c/manual/web2c_10.html#SEC67">gftype</a>
program by D.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Fuchs, as well as a program to
convert a .gf file into a collection of GIF images (one for
each character in the font).
